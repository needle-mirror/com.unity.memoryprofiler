# Compare two snapshots

You can use the **Compare Snapshots** mode in the [Snapshots component](snapshots-component) to compare two snapshots together. When you enable this mode, select any two snapshots to open them both in a comparison view in the [Main component](main-component). The [Summary tab](summary-tab) and the [Unity Objects tab](unity-objects-tab) can display comparison views; the [All Of Memory tab](all-memory-tab) is only visible when you select a single snapshot.
