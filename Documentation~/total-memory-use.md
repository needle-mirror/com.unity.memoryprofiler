# Total memory use

Inspect your application's total memory use regularly to identify problems with memory use as early as possible, such as if your application uses too much memory for the target platform. Capture snapshots often and in a variety of circumstances - don't rely entirely on a capture of your application running in the Editor in Play mode, for example.

For instructions on how to capture and open snapshots, see [Capture a snapshot](snapshot-capture.md#capture-a-snapshot) and [Opening snapshots](snapshot-capture.md#opening-snapshots). After you capture and open a snapshot, you can inspect the snapshot in a variety of ways using the different available tabs.

Use the [All Of Memory](all-memory-tab.md) tab to see how much memory your application uses in total. This is useful if your application needs to meet a target size for memory use because you can see the exact total that your application uses.
