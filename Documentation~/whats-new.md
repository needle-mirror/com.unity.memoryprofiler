# What's new in version 1.0.0-pre.3

## Added

* Added the __All Of Memory__ snapshots comparison tab.
* Added a __Close__ button to close snapshots. Single-clicking a selected snapshot no longer closes it.

## Updated

* Removed the __Swap__ button from the __Compare Snapshots__ workflow. To change which snapshots you compare, you must now close one of the currently selected snapshots before you select a new one.
* Removed colors from the __A__ and __B__ UI elements in snapshots comparisons.
* The details view UI now hides the __References__ section if the selected item doesn't have any references.

## Fixed

* Renaming a snapshot no longer allows you to use the same name as another snapshot with some letters in a different case.
