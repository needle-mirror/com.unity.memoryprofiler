# References component

The __References__ component displays how objects reference each other in your snapshot. Use this component to see how the selected object is linked to other objects.

</br>The References component

The component has two tabs to display reference information:

* The __Referenced By__ tab shows the tree of references from the selected object.
* The __References To__ tab shows a list of objects that the selected object references.

The References component displays the selected object's name regardless of whether it contains any references. If a selected object does contain references or if another object references the selected object, then the component lists the references in the appropriate tab.

By default, the entries in the __Referenced By__ tab are collapsed and only show the root object. Select objects that belong to a hierarchy to expand them and see the full reference hierarchy of the object.

In the __References To__ tab, the component only displays all directly referenced objects but not the objects referenced by these.
