# References view

The References view displays how objects reference each other in your snapshot. Use this view to see how the selected object is linked to other objects. The view has two tabs to display reference information:

* The Referenced By tab shows the tree of references from the selected object.
* The References To tab shows a list of objects that the selected object references.

The References view displays the selected object's name regardless of whether it contains any references. If a selected object does contain references or if another object references the selected object, then the view lists the references in the appropriate tab.

The view also lists each object with an icon to indicate whether it's a managed or native object.

In the Referenced By tab, you can select objects that belong to a hierarchy to expand them and see the full reference hierarchy of the object.

In the References To tab, the view only displays all directly referenced objects but not the objects referenced by these.
