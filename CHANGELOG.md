### Changed
 - Changed the managed data crawler to use a stack based approach in order to avoid stack overflows when processing large amounts of managed object references.
 - Fixed an issue where attempting to rename a snapshot with two snapshots open would cause an I/O sharing violation, due to the other snapshot being closed instead.

### Changed
 - Reworked the "MemoryMap" to display memory allocations in a more intuitive way, allowing better understanding of the captured memory layout.

 - General UX improvements.

### Removed
 - Removed "Diff" button from the snapshot entries inside the "Workbench".
 - Removed "Delete" button from the snapshot entries inside the "Workbench". Delete can instead be found in the menu under the options cogwheel of the snapshot.
